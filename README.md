## General Description
My first VueJS app apart from work
Made this app as a result to keep track of our household receipts management
To keep track of similar things that we buy over a course of time
Where we spend high and low
To determine patterns as well

## My Vision of v2 on this app
To able to convert images of receipts and store individual iteams|prices|total
automatically upon uploading the image into its own separate transaction.

## Tech  Side
Uses VueJS for UI
A reasonable sqlite3 DB for keeping track of transactions/receipts
NodeJS based server and ExpressJS the goto Middleware
